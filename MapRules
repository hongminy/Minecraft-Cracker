# The map is a rectangal with edge length 40 grids
# It is made by cobblestone
# There are several obstacles each with area of 1 or 4 across the center 
# We have 3 agents in total, two fighting each other and the rest one as a spectator
# The agents both have Life = 20 and unlimited number of "fireballs" to throw 
# The first one who kills the opponent is the winner of the game
