## Summary of the Proj
###Minecraft-Cracker is a smart Minecraft combat agent that is designed to be optimized in our 1v1 Minecraft combat arena. The arena is designed to be competitive and tactical with obstacles, platforms and utility items. The rule is simple, at the end of the combat, the one player who still stands prevails. For our smart agent, a state might be a vector with multiple inputs like the location of the 2 players, the presence of certain items in the arena, the weapon they're using, etc. The trained policy function will then output a rational action to the state it is currently in.
