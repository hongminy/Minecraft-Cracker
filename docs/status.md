## What did we do?
We made two of the maps that would be our future arena to train our AI.
We wrote a basic agent that work as the parent class of other more complicated agents.
We made a random agent that pick eligible acts randomly.
We modified the game logistics to make throwing a fireball possible.


## What is next?
Get more features/datas fit in our agent e.g. posotions of enemy, health of enemy, health of agent ect.
Collect enough training data by human input.
Build the Q-table that work for our data and find the optimized step size (tuning).


## Evaluation Plan
As a baseline, we expect our agent at least to perform rationally as a player in the arena we made, for example, attacking when the opponent is close, jumping to clear the obstacles and moving around normally. After an extended training and having a better designed Q-table, we want our agent to create a somewhat challenging combat environment for the other player. This involves the agent to be tactical, aggressive or conservative depends on its situation, good at using items, and well worn for combat.
